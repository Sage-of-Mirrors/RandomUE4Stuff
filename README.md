# Random UE4 Stuff

A couple of projects I made/am making for Unreal Engine 4\. Assets are in `RandomUE4Stuff\Content\ThirdPersonBP`.

* Dialog: A dialog system I developed for my university Capstone game.
* Lyre: An Ocarina of Time-style instrument system.
* Chao: A re-implementation of the A-Life (Chao) system from the Sonic Adventure games.

Big thanks to [Justin113D](https://github.com/Justin113D) for the Chao models, animations, and morph targets.
